# Neverwinter Nights Voice Pack for EE 2.6+

## Overview
This mod adds Neverwinter Nights voicesets as selectable player voicesets to the Infinity Engine (Baldur's Gate/Baldur's Gate II/Icewind Dale) Enhanced Edition games version 2.6 or above.

## Limitations
Due to inconsistency between individual voicesets in the source games, and the differences between voiceset systems, not every voiceset covers every role. Campaign-banter responses are used to pad sets where possible. Discrepancies between characters are commonplace.

## Version history
### 0.1.0
Initial release.

Adds the following characters:
 - Sharwyn (HOTU)
 - Sharwyn (TWD)
 - Aribeth de Tylmarande (TWD)
